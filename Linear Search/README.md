# Linear Search Algorithm 
# The problem:
  Find a given number in an ordered array of numbers. More specifically, given an integer x and vector v [0..n-1] of integers, find an index m such that v [m] == x.
    Of course, not every instance of this problem has a solution. Consider, for example, the instances where v [i-1] <x <v [i] for some i.

# Cases
Vector lenght: 4
Possible output: [10,20,40,47]

Key: 20
Output: The key belongs to the array
