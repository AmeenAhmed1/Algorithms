# Algorithms Bucket

## Overview

We know that algorithms is something that maybe can be not our entire day by day, but we can't say that it's unuseful to our code in our jobs or even to help us to get a new job. How many times you got stucked in a job interview when you were asked to solve this type of problems?

To get better theres is no magice recipe, but only training and this repository has as main objective to help you to improve your algorithm skills (or help other with you knowledge in this area!).

## How to Contribute

You can do it in three ways:

1. Submitting a pull request with an Algorithm to invite community to solve with you (or just to challenge everyone to do it)

2. Solving a submited algorithm, in a specific language (because we can have different solutions in different languages, and its awesome)

3. Submitting a algorith and its solution, because the idea here is also provide solved content for those who are starting in its studies to get adopted to the idea and how to do it (also creating discussion about your solution)

### Submitting an Algorithm Without Solution

* Create a folder with name like <algorithm-name and <algorithm-name>.md file inside it with question description. Add also test cases for your algorithm (can be inside <algorithm-name>.md file or in different files with testcase1, testcase2 ... testcaseN name. These three things are required for submitting a question!
  
* Duplicated Algorithms questions will not be accepted, the idea here is have a lot of different algorithms

### Submitting a Solution

* Create a file with algorithm name and your username as file name and language extension inside algorithm folder, for example, algorithm-name-drcabral.kt for kotlin, with your solution inside. Make sure that your code works and solve the question, passing at least with posted test cases.

* Different solutions with the same language will be accepted if the solutions uses a different approach.

### Submitting a Algorithm with Solution

* Just follow the instructions above for each, algorithm and solution.

## Hacktoberfest 2020!

Of course we now are focused in Hacktoberfest 2020! Let's contribute with community and have a chance to receive event prizes!
